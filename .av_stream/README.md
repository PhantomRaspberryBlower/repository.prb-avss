Audio Video Streaming Service (AVSS)
====================================

The AVSS program turns a Raspberry Pi into a audio video streaming service that can either live stream to Facebook or broadcast using UDP. The RPi needs to have Raspbian Lite installed and a few things connected to the GPIO (general purpose input output) pins. An LED, a switch and a Peizo speaker; we also need to have a PiCamera (the offical camera for the RPi) and a USB sound card with a line in. This was created for a local radio station to live stream the DJ's to Facebook and allow a mixing desk to be connected.

When AVSS starts it uses the audio headphone socket to speak the Pi's IP address. Using this IP address AVSS can be configured using a web browser by navigating to the IP address of the Pi on port 8000. For example if the Pi's IP address is 192.168.0.10 navigate to http://192.168.0.10:8000. Here we can set the Facebook stream key which allows the Pi to access Facebook's streaming service. You can optionally stream using udp on port 4569; then use Kodi or VLC to connect to the stream;  VLC go to http://@192.168.0.10:4569 or for Kodi you can create an strm file containing http://192.168.0.10:4569

With the Pi being headless (no keyboard, no mouse or monitor) each time the Pi starts it beeps twice to notify the user that the Pi is ready. If the headphones are connected you will hear "Hello this is Raspberry Pi and my IP address is ...". To start a stream press the switch once; it now beeps 4 times and the LED remains on to inidicate that the Pi is streaming you will also hear "Starting Stream". To stop the stream press the switch again; it now beeps once and the LED goes out you will hear "Ending Stream". To shutdown the Pi press and hold the switch for four seconds; it beeps three times indicating it is safe to unplug and hear "Shutting Down".
