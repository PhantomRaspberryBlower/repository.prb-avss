Stream Audio & Video to Facebook or UDP

=======================================

Initial Setup Process:
----------------------
Connect the network cable, USB Soundcard, the power cable and headphones. When the Pi has started you should hear
"Hello this is the audio video streaming service and my I P address is" followed by the IP address of the device.
Using another computer connected to the network downloadand install TightVNC. Using TightVNC connect to the Pi using the IP 
address discovered earlier with port number 4569 i.e. 192.168.0.11::4569.
Type in the username (pi) and password (raspberry). OBS Studio is installed but this is for testing purposes only, as currently
(April 2021) OBS Studio can't utilize the GPU for hardware encoding, leaving only software encoding. When recording or streaming
this over-works the poor Pi which can only a manage 20fps at a resolution of 960x540; the CPU will reach 75 degrees centigrade
very rapidly. This should not be used for long periods as I say only for testing purposes. From now on you no longer need
to have a monitor, keyboard or mouse connected to the RPi. You can connect using TightVNC from another PC. :)

Startup Process:
----------------
Power up the RPi and wait until you hear 2 beeps and if headphones are connected the words "Hello this is the audio video
streaming service and my I P address is" followed by the IP address of the device. This indicates the Pi is ready to 
start streaming.

Start Stream:
-------------
Press the switch once to start streaming to facebook (using the supplied stream key) or for testing purposes broadcast using
UDP (i.e. udp://224.0.0.1:4569). The LED, speaker will flash and beep 4 times (morse code letter 'v' for videoing)
before starting the stream if headphones are connected you will also hear the words "Starting stream". Once streaming begins
the led remains on.

End Stream:
-----------
To stop the stream press the switch again the LED and speaker will flash and beep once (morse code lettr 'e' for ending)
and the words "Ending stream" can be heard through the headphones. The LED will remain off once the stream has ended.


Shutdown Process:
-----------------
To power down the RPi press and hold the switch for four seconds; the led flashes and the speaker beeps three times (morse code
letter 's' for shutdown) and the words "Shutting down" can be heard through headphones before starting the shutdown process.


Overview:
---------
1. Press switch to start/stop Stream
2. Turn on led when streaming
3. If stream fails led starts blinking:
	a. Long slow LED blinking means unable to connect
	b. Fast LED linking means connected but the stream key is incorrect
4. Long press (4 sec or more) stop current stream, flash led three times and shutdown
