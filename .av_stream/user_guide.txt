Audio Video Streaming Service Help
==================================

Turn a Raspberry Pi into a audio video streaming service that can live stream to Facebook, Periscope,
Twitch, Ustream, Vimeo, YouTube simultaneously or can broadcast via UDP on port 4569.

Basic Operation:
----------------
1. Switch on beeps twice when ready.
2. Press switch to start/stop stream LED lights up when streaming.
3. Long press (4 sec or more) to shutdown.

Things We Need:
---------------
  Raspberry Pi      Pi Camera     Network Cable
  USB Soundcard     Headphones    Power Cable 

Initial Setup Process:
----------------------
Connect the headphones, network cable, USB soundcard, power cable and power up the Raspberry Pi. Put the 
headphones on within a minute of the Pi starting and you will hear "Hello this is Raspberry Pi and my IP 
address is ...". Write down the IP address, you will also hear through the built-in speaker two beeps to 
notify you that the Pi is ready. Using a computer connected to the local network open a web browser and 
type the IP address you wrote down i.e. if the IP address is "192.168.0.10" type "http://192.168.0.10".
This displays a webpage with a preview of the camera image and the settings you can change. At the 
bottom of the page are buttons to save, reset and links to help and info. Click onto the help link for 
further operating instructions.

Startup Process:
----------------
Power up the RPi and wait until you hear 2 beeps; if headphones are connected the words "Hello this is 
Raspberry Pi and my IP address is ..." followed by the IP address of the device. This indicates the Pi 
is ready to start streaming.

Start Stream:
-------------
Press the switch once to start streaming to your chosen live stream provider (using the supplied stream 
key) or for to test your settings before going live you can select 'Startup UDP'. This broadcasts over 
the local area network (LAN) using UDP (i.e. udp://224.0.0.1:4569). The LED, speaker will flash and 
beep 4 times (morse code letter 'v' for videoing) before starting the stream if headphones are 
connected you will also hear the words "Starting stream" Once streaming begins the led remains on.

End Stream:
-----------
To stop the stream press the switch again the LED and speaker will flash and beep once (morse code 
letter 'e' for ending) and the words "Ending stream" can be heard through the headphones. The LED will
remain off once the stream has stopped

Shutdown Process:
-----------------
To power down the RPi press and hold the switch for four seconds; the led flashes and the speaker beeps
three times (morse code letter 's' for shutdown) and the words "Shutting down" can be heard through 
headphones before starting the shutdown process.

Advanced Setup:
---------------
Using a computer connected to the local network we can connect to the Pi, Secure Shell Protocol (SSH).
To connect using SSH download and install Putty. Using Putty connect to the Pi with the IP address you 
wrote down i.e. if the IP address is "192.168.0.10" type 192.168.0.10. Type in the username (pi) and 
password (default is raspberry). Once connected using SSH type 'cd /home/pi/.av_stream' to change 
directory; type 'ls -a' to view all the files for Audio Video Streaming Service.

Config file:
------------
The config file can be found in the /home/pi/.av_stream directory. Click onto Info button to see
a list of all the settings available, some settings can only be only be modified using SSH or VNC.

Updates:
--------
Updates are downloaded and installed either every day, every week, or every month. You can choose 
to also update/upgrade the operating system. 

Troubleshooter:
---------------
If you hear the sos distress message in morse code (ie dot-dot-dot dash-dash-dash dot-dot-dot) repeating,
either plug in a pair of headphones and listen to one of the following error messages:

  "Warning no camera detected"
  "Warning no USB sound card detected"
  "Warning no network detected"
  "Warning no internet detected"

or you can open the info webpage scroll down to Hardware and check that the camera, sound card, network
and internet have been detected:

  Hardware:
    Camera Supported: True
    Camera Detected: True
    USB Sound Card Detected: True
    Network Detected: True
    Internet Detected: True

If any of the above is set to False check that the cables are connected properly.

GPIO Pin Configuration:
-----------------------
The Raspberry Pi has a 40 pin connector some of which can be used as inputs or outputs. These connectors
are called General Purpose Input Output pins. The following pin numbers have been allocated:

    Pin 4 ...... Positive Cooling Fan + (red cable) 5v
    Pin 6 ...... Negative Cooling Fan - (black cable)
    Pin 8 ...... PWM Cooling Fan Switch (blue cable)
    Pin 12 ..... Streaming LED + (red cable)
    Pin 14 ..... Streaming LED - (white cable)
    Pin 17 ..... Streaming Switch + (red cable) 3v
    Pin 18 ..... Streaming Switch - (black cable)
    Pin 30 ..... Piezo Speaker - (black cable)
    Pin 36 ..... Piezo Speaker + (red cable)
